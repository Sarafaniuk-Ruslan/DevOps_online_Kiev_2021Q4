In first task I generated my ssh key for my rep (to connect git remote), but before that created my own acc for git. Then I did clone of my rep and built tree by using task guide.
Made init in folder task1.1, create html file + commit, but before added readme.txt file to commit and created branch called develop. 
Create new branch images, in new folder added random image, 'add .' and commited then changed index.html. 
After that we mooved to develop branch and create from it branch style. In this branch, I created new folder and file css in it. Made a commit. Change html by adding link with css. Made a commit.

I created a problem with merging two branchs and had conflict in code. I resolved the problem by editing code in html in styles branch and commited it.
Then pushed all my master branch


What does DevOps meens for me?
I see me in future like a man whose have anything and be everywhere. DevOps is the man with perfect reaction, all situation when he needs at the moment, DevOps appeares
with interesting noise and help you. He is a hero in IT industry. Stress moments don't bit his block. Quenching in workplace will give all potential in job.
DevOps is really hard working and interesting.
