Hello everybody!)

In first few tasks I interrupted in interesting problem with CPU Virtual support. I checked this option. I made copy of my first ubuntu server and did group for couple of servers. Try myself to give ip v4 for my virtual machines, for this part I uped dhcp server by VB. Made snapshot of my conf of first vm and do it again after installing all needs.
Installed usb plugin.
Opened site with download link of vagrant and installed it on my PC. Made init and stared it. By using putty looked interesting commands. Created Vagrant Box with 0.0.1 version and configured it on my vagrant.
