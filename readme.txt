What does DevOps meens for me?
I see me in future like a man whose have anything and be everywhere. DevOps is the man with perfect reaction, all situation when he needs at the moment, DevOps appeares
with interesting noise and help you. He is a hero in IT industry. Stress moments don't bit his block. Quenching in workplace will give all potential in job.
DevOps is really hard working and interesting.
